## Overview
This project is an email client application developed as part of a technical assignment for Shipster. The application classifies emails into categories such as Immediate Attention, Promotional, Updates, and Junk. It includes a user-friendly interface built with React and Bootstrap, and a backend API built with Python and Flask for managing email data and rules. Emails are classified using a rule basede filtering approach with help from Natural Language Processing (spaCy) to support multiple languages. Given more data, a hybrid classification approach would be used with a machine learning model. Similarly, an SQLLite database would also be added to store stateful data and improve category management features described below.

## Features
- **Email Classification**: Automatically categorize emails based on predefined rules.
- **Category Management**: Add, edit, and delete categories and their associated rules.
- **Email Search**: Search emails by sender, subject, or body content.
- **Detailed Email View**: Click on an email to view detailed information.
- **Analytics Screen**: View email statistics, including a pie chart of email categories and classification confidence levels.

## Setup Instructions

###  Software needed

To run this project locally you will need the following softwares installed.

1. Node.js 
    - If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Miniconda
    - If you haven't installed Miniconda yet, you can download and install it from [Miniconda's official website](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).
3. Git

Clone the repository 
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/17swifts/Email-classifier.git
   cd Email-classifier
```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install dependencies: `conda create --name emailclassifier --file requirements.txt`
3. Activate conda environent `conda activate emailclassifier`
4. Run the server: `python main.py`

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Classification Logic

- Emails are read from the file with utf-8 encoding for non qwerty characters.
- The language of the email is detected using Natural Language Processing library spaCy 
- Emails are classified using rule based filtering, where the category with the most hits/ count is assigned to that email
- Rules are stored in as json/ dict in a separate rules.py file

## Usage
### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server.
2. Start the frontend server.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Assumptions & Limitations

- Given the provided 20 emails is the training set for classification, the correct category must be known for accuracy testing. This was not provided, therefore, I manually classified the emails based on my personal understanding of the categories. 
- The application uses useState and useEffect components of React to store state variables, however all changes made during the session are not stored in a database or external data store. Therefore for each session new categories or edits made are wiped. With more time I would implement a database using SQLite
- Classifcation of emails only supports 3 languages, English, Dutch and Danish. So whilst it supports multiple lanaguges, it is not scalable without further development. 

## React Components

- **App.js**: Main application component that integrates all other components.
- **Header.js**: Header component with a button to open the Analytics screen.
- **Footer.js**: Footer component with copyright 
- **SearchBar.js**: Component for searching emails and adding category.
- **CategoryTabs.js**: Tabs for selecting and managing email categories.
- **CategoryForm.js**: Form for adding and editing categories.
- **EmailList.js**: List of emails.
- **EmailItem.js**: Individual email item with a dropdown for changing categories.
- **EmailDetail.js**: Detailed view of a selected email.
- **Analytics.js**: Screen displaying email statistics and analytics.

## Backend API

- **GET /emails**: Fetch all emails.
- **PUT /emails/<id>**: Update the category of an email.
- **GET /rules**: Fetch all classification rules.
- **POST /rules**: Add a new rule.
- **PUT /rules/**: Edit an existing rule.
- **DELETE /rules/**: Delete a rule.

## Technologies Used    

- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap, react-bootstrap, react-avatar, react-chartjs-2, chart.js
- **Backend**: Python, spaCy, Flask, Flask-CORS

## Approach

- 1 hour understanding the project
- Background research on the best methods for email classification
- UI/UX design
    - Started with hand drawn mockup and ideas
    - I can use the mockup to create component names 
    - I wanted the emails to look like how Gmail or outlook display emails in a list. Having a similar design to existing applications resonates with users, and the familiarity is appealing 
    - I also wanted a clean and simple color scheme that emulated that used by The Shipping Collective 
- Implement classification of emails as python file
- Using mock classified email, created the UI
- Created main python file with endpoints in flask to fetch from the front end
- Improved styling 
- Created basic testing plan
- Tested features of the application
- Fixed any small bugs or styling issues

## Classification Lit Review and Thoughts

- Multiple approaches for classifiers 
    - **Rule-Based Filtering**
        - Easy to implement and can be effective for well-defined tasks.
        - Tailor the rules to the specific scenario
        - Risk of overfitting to the provided data
        - Risk of scalability because rules need to be updated as we encounter new patterns. Too many rules too frequently 
        - Risk of scalability because it only works for the specified languages. Adding more requires further maintenance
        - Risk of Coverage as it may miss nuances in text that machine learning models could capture.
        - Could use a translator to convert to a common language i.e English however through testing it was found to be extremely slow and also risks incorrectly translating nuances to languages 
    - **Machine learning**
        - Assumes that the category field exists in the JSON data and is correctly labelled (we do not have this)
        - Requires enough labelled data for each category to train the model effectively (we do not have this)
        - Major data dependencies 
        - Easily scalable for languages and coverage 
        - Automatically identifies and learns features relevant to classification from the data, potentially uncovering complex patterns
        - Risk for overfitting like rule based filtering 
    - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques**
        - Can understand nuances in text unlike the other methods 
        - Take a long time to run and can be resource heavy 
        - Some technical complexity not needed in this case
    - **Hybrid Approaches** (using both rule-based and ML for example)
        - Is more flexible because it combines strengths of different methods to improve overall performance.
        - Can address limitations of individual approaches, such as combining rule-based methods with machine learning to handle edge cases.
- Ideally I would want to use a hybrid approach, as this would cover all edge cases and be more scalable and maintainable, however with data limitations I followed a simple rule based filtering approach 
- Research on the classification of emails topic showed a preference for machine learning as the main approach. Especially when it came to spam or not spam. Algorithms of note were Support Vector Classification (SVC), Na√Øve Bayes (NB) or Artifical Neural Networks (AAN). However, each of these studies had a labelled dataset of more than 1000 emails. With only 20 emails unlabelled, such an approach would not be feasile.
- I wrote an example program using SVC algorithm, however only had a maximum accuracy of 0.4 which is not acceptable for this project

## Testing

For this project I considered doing unit tests for both the front and backend. For python and flask, I would have used `pytest` to mock and check the endpoints. For react, the built in node testing with `App.test.js` would have been extended past loading the App page. However, with time constraints I decided to focus on Functional Testing the of features developed and documented manually.
